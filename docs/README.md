> this documentation is **not** definitive **nor** yet implemented.

## Examples

In the [`examples`](./examples/) folder there are examples of programs and modules
written in **calc**, they're not yet been tested, they're actually only examples of
how **calc** syntax is.

## Design

In the [`design`](./design/) folder there is descibed the current and, probably,
the future design of the **calc** programming language, with proposals, ideas,
issues and features about each language's construct.
