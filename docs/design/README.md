## Introduction

This folder contains proposals, ideas and issues about the **calc** programming language
design and possible implementations. This documentation is **not** a reference of the
language **nor** a specification of its features, each construct described, will not
necessarily be implemented.

The design of the **calc** language will be based on th examples in the [`examples`](/docs/examples/)
folder.
